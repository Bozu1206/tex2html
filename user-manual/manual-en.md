## Description

Our extension is a tool that allows you to convert your LaTeX document
into HTML, before generating PDFs. The goal is to allow visually
impaired people to get a more proofreadable document than the PDF. The
extension is available on the [VSCode
marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ATC.tex2html).

## Installation

*Note:* you must have `python`, `pandoc` and a LaTeX compiler installed on your machine. On Windows, you can simply follow the instructions of pop-up messages for installation. See `INSTALL.md` for more information.\

LaTeX compiler is only required to get the PDF. The default compiler is `pdflatex`, if you want to use another compiler, you can specify in the extension settings.


To install the extension, you have several option:

- Install it directly from the [VSCode
    marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ATC.tex2html)
    by clicking on the install button.

- From the VSCode editor, go to the extension tab, search for  `tex2html` and click on install.
